## Overview

The Unity Container (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container. It facilitates building loosely coupled applications and provides developers with the following advantages:

* Simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures and dependencies
* Abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns
* Increased flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container
* Service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container
* Instance and type interception
* Registration by convention
